DESCRIPTION
===========
This module channels unpublished content as well as edits to current content
into a queue for review by a moderator/publisher prior to becoming "live", i.e.
visible to the public.

We took our inspiration from the Revision Moderation module by Angie Byron,
but found that a patch could not implement the deviating functionality our
customers required, which would change the current behaviour of the RM module
and surprise existing users.

INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION
============================
Step-by-step instructions can be found in the tutorials listed on the 
Revisioning project page, http://drupal.org/project/revisioning.
