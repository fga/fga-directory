This module provides location feed mappers.  Originally this was created
as a patch for the feeds module (http://drupal.org/node/623428) with work
from

  JayCally        - http://drupal.org/user/297917
  pdrake          - http://drupal.org/user/426817

Simple GeoRSS support has been added for points: http://georss.org/simple
Adding support for the other simple georss types should be relatively
easy but would also require support on the node end. Patches welcome.
